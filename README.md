# Tupl√©

Despite tuples being very much like fixed-count arrays, they are not equipped with much of the built-in functionality that is provided for any type of collection in the standard library. ‚òπÔ∏è 

This package addresses some of the omissions, bringing tuples and collections closer to feature parity.

## N√©ming

The name of this package is **Tupl√©**. The homophone "Tuplay" is only used when necessary. (E.g. GitHub cannot handle acute accents. ü´§)  

## Dependency 

Tupl√© is in the "Major Version Zero" phase, allowing for rapid development based on community feedback. 

Refer to [this semantic versioning reference](https://docs.swift.org/package-manager/PackageDescription/PackageDescription.html#version) for the following. 

Until reaching 1.0.0‚Ä¶
1. ***Minor*** releases will use the rules laid out for post-1.x ***major*** releases.
2. ***Patch*** releases will use the rules laid out for post-1.x ***minor*** versions, along with standard patch rules.
 
This means you'll need to use the "Up to Next ***Minor*** Version" dependency rule if you need to avoid breaking changes.

## Note on licensing

Because software must be licensed to be practically usable, we release this package under the standard MIT license. This license was chosen for its ubiquity and perceived ease of compliance.

While you can consider this as legally valid as any other use of the MIT license, it does not indicate that we philosophically endorse the use of this license, or any software license we currently know of.
